# Introduction

I am Rayffer, a developer with almost a decade of experience in the field of C# and .NET mainly, recently delving into other technologies as well as getting familiar with using docker development environments.

## Current projects

A custom tool to run TTRPG games easing most of the management tasks that make the DM life hard, based on the 5e SRD.

I am also working on contributing to the tools I consume on this project like [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot) as well as a variety of side projects aimed at easing my work and keeping up to date.

## Currently learning

Web development technologies, since it's a field I've recently started working on as well as learning Rust and its pitfalls.
